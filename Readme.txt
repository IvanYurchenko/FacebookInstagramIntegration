1. You need to change FacebookSettings.AccessToken to real AccessToken (would be taken from another place in a production application)
2. Posting image to IG and getting impressions does not work because FB API throws errors when trying to access it in a way specified in the documentation.

A lot of other things were used like articles on stackoverflow, forums, etc. - with no result.
